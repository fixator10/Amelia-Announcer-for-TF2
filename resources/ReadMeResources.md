# Resources

Resources exists because I need examples to understand what is needed for the Announcer Pack

Resources also exists so I have a central place to convert audio files

### What's used?

  - An Extracted and trimmed down version of tf2_sound_vo_eng_dir.vpk
  - A copy of the scripts folder from DavidLink's Sound Script mod
  - The Stanely Fortress 2 Announcer Pack: Pick & Choose
